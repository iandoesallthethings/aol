# America Online

My dad misses the pageantry of connecting to AOL, so I'm building out the whole experience with the intention of setting it as his new tab page or something. Maybe build it as a chrome extension?

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deploying

So far, this app is running in Vercel. Just fork the repo on github, login to Vercel, and deploy this repo. `adapter-auto` works fine. :D
